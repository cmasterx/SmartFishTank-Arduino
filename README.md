# SmartFishTank-Arduino
This Smart Fish Tank Monitoring System is fish maintenance and monitoring ecosystem that lets fish owners manage and control their fish tank with ease. This ecosystem consists of an Arduino monitoring the temperature, pH level, and turbidity (water clarity) of the tank. The Arduino will report these data to a Raspberry Pi, which then uses this data to control the temperature of the tank with a heater. This fish tank monitoring system can then be controlled from a website.

## Branches
- **master** Arduino Code in C++ and Raspberry Pi Code in Python 
- **webpage** Python webserver and website for remote communication to the Smart Fish Tank Hardware 
- **CAD** 3D CAD for 3D Printing
